## Executing the tests

By default, the tests will run using Chrome. You can run them in Firefox by overriding the `driver` system property, e.g.

> $ mvn clean verify -Ddriver=firefox -Dcucumber.filter.tags=@test


The test results will be recorded in the `target/site/serenity` directory.

## Generating the reports
Since the Serenity reports contain aggregate information about all of the tests, they are not generated after each individual test (as this would be extremenly inefficient). Rather, The Full Serenity reports are generated by the `serenity-maven-plugin`. You can trigger this by running `mvn serenity:aggregate` from the command line or from your IDE.

They reports are also integrated into the Maven build process: the following code in the `pom.xml` file causes the reports to be generated automatically once all the tests have completed when you run `mvn verify`?
